# Exercise 1 [Science Cloud]
Created a VM, connected, created a working version of cowsay and implemented the poisson solver. 

# Exercise 2 [Containers]
Installed Docker, created a Dockerfile for the poisson solver, uploaded it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/wanibo) and ran it on the VM (had some trouble with connecting the output but in the end it worked fine). <br />
