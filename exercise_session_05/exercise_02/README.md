# Part 1:
**Do you observe any changes in the terminal output compared to usual compilation during the previous sessions?** g++ so the C++ compiler <br />
**Which parts of the code took the most CPU time?** forces line.23 <br />
**Can you make sense of why?** the line after the actual force calculation <br />

# Part 2:
Wasn't able to seperate and compile, couldn't resolve the error at: <br />
cc   nbody_seperated.o forces.o initial_conditions.o   -o nbody_seperated <br />
--> undefined references I couldn't resolve.
