# Exercise Session 05 #
In this session, we will first practise regular expressions using `grep` command as well as in the context of data parsing. Moreover, we will profile a simple N-body gravity code using `perftools-lite`. Also, we will investigate the complexity of this code and understand the use of `argc` and `argv` parameters. 

In this folder you can find:

* binary.txt : the data used in the first part of Exercise 1
* measurements.txt : the data used in the second part of Exercise 1
* nbody.cpp : the serial version of the gravity code needed for Exercises 2 and 3
